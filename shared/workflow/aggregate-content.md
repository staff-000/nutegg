## Output Format
Respond in this EXACT JSON format (no markdown, no code fence, just the JSON object):
The `time` field shown on mind-map nodes is optional: include it only when a source timestamp supports that node. For text-based content, include `sources` on each supported node with the original section heading/location hint in `ref` and a distinctive exact excerpt in `quote`. If citing a captured discussion item, also include its exact `sourceId`.

  "titleVerdict": "direct answer to the title's question",
  "coreSummary": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2"],
  "mindMap": [
    {
      "name": "First Main Topic",
      "detail": "Core idea",

    }

## Output Rules
- Preserve attribution between author text and commenter claims. Video/article summaries must not present commenters’ claims as the author’s ideas. Forum summaries may describe the debate with attribution.
- mindMap: synthesized concept tree for the entire work, up to 3 levels deep, integrating points from across the parts. Have main branches directly at the root level (do NOT wrap in a single overall root node).
- customQuestionAnswers: one entry per DISTINCT user question (empty array when none). When citing sources, use timestamps or section headers from the Part summaries.
- mindMap time: optional at any node. For timestamped video content, cite the exact source timestamp supporting that node, as MM:SS or H:MM:SS. Omit time when unavailable; never invent timestamps. Preserve source timestamps when combining branches, and do not substitute chunk start times for evidence.
- Preserve source references and exact quotes on mind-map nodes when combining parts. Never replace an original reference with a generated topic title or summary; omit sources when unsupported.
