Title: {{title}}
Discussion kind: {{kind}}
Author's body (context only): {{body}}
Parent comments (context only, do not classify or count): {{parents}}
Discussion items to analyze: {{items}}

Identify distinct topics/questions people are debating and their specific arguments and perspectives. Group similar views, usually into 3\u20135 short topics. Exclude spam, advertisements, empty praise and emoji-only responses. Preserve substantive minority views, corrections, examples and first-hand experiences.
Classify relevant local item IDs against each group's specific claim: agree, disagree, mixed, neutral or unclear. Include every relevant item, not just highlights; omit empty stance lists. A reply's agreement is not necessarily agreement with the original author. Use parent context; keep different answer authors' claims separate. Without author text, never infer video contents or invent an author position. Reactions indicate popularity, not truth or audience consensus.
Use a 2\u20136 word title, a short internal claim, and a one-sentence fallback summary. Paraphrase 1\u20133 highlights per group in at most 20 words each; avoid background, commenter names, attribution and repeated points. A correction or insightful, detail-rich comment adding useful information beyond the body is a supplement: preserve its method, evidence, experience or caveats in 1\u20132 sentences, at most 50 words. Mark supplement:true; at most two per group, without repeating them as ordinary highlights.
Return only JSON using local numeric IDs (including highlights), no counts or original quotes:
{"topics":[{"id":"t1","title":"topic","claim":"specific proposition","summary":"brief fallback","stances":{"agree":[0,2],"disagree":[1],"neutral":[3]},"highlights":[{"commentId":0,"summary":"concise argument or experience"},{"commentId":3,"summary":"useful additional detail","supplement":true}]}]}

## Entry Generation
{{entry_generation}}

## Task
1. Treat the egg\u2019s Scope, Action Guide and Formatting Rules as the primary specification for which insights to capture and how to present them. Use the Stage 1 mind map to locate relevant concepts, relationships and evidence; verify all claims and timestamps against the raw source. Do not convert every mind-map branch into an entry. The mind map may cover the whole work; in a chunk, use only evidence present in that part. Preserve useful AMA question\u2013answer pairs, examples, qualifications and disagreements. Do not repeat the general mind map or force every result into a concept/explanation template.
2. Answer the exact Key Questions directly with supporting source locations/brief quotes. Use "Not addressed in this content" (or "Not addressed in this part" for chunks) when there is no supported answer. Do not mistake missing coverage for an absent answer.
3. When entry generation is enabled, extract concise, substantive results as markdown entries specifically serving this egg\u2019s instructions. If the egg instructions ask for no knowledge entries, return extractedEntries: [] even when the UI enables generation. Lists/frameworks retain all supported items and order; a chunk may contain a partial framework for later assembly. Do not invent missing fragments. Avoid repeating the same answer in both keyQuestionAnswers and extractedEntries.
4. Recommend what the user gains by opening the original AFTER reading the condensed analysis:
   - full: useful depth spans the source.
   - highlights: specific worthwhile passages; identify their source locations.
   - summary: the condensed result covers the useful substance.
   - skip: poor fit, low substance, or dominated by Skip If.
   - uncertain: insufficient evidence or coverage.
   Apply Scope, Key Questions, Worth Reading If and Skip If to the evidence. Mixed content may warrant highlights rather than skipping it all. Empty preference lists use this rubric, never an automatic yes. Explain the benefit/limitation in one concise reason. For chunks this is provisional evidence for a whole-source decision.
5. Do not claim novelty relative to the user's notes, unfamiliarity to the user, external factual verification, or unseen visual demonstrations. Worth Reading If and Skip If affect only the recommendation. Entry-generation opt-outs take priority over extraction tasks. Never include author/source URL metadata in entry bodies; it is appended mechanically.

## Task
1. Preserve existing user-authored branches and structure. Do not delete or rename them.
2. Consolidate genuinely equivalent claims across pending entries and the tree. Retain ALL distinct author/source lines, examples, caveats and qualifications. A familiar concept is not a reason to discard its new substantive details or attribution.
3. Assemble supported complementary fragments (an early partial mention and a later explanation) into a complete entry. Do not invent missing relationships or items.
4. For frameworks/lists from the same source/version, assemble fragments, preserve source order and every distinct item. Equal titles alone do not establish equivalence: different speakers, versions, dates or contexts remain distinguishable.
5. Preserve disagreements, contradictions and counterexamples explicitly with their sources. Never silently choose a winner or average incompatible claims into agreement.
6. Place consolidated entries under relevant parents; create minimal new branches only when needed. Unresolved fragments remain Unprocessed.
7. Reading preferences/recommendations are NEVER merge rejection criteria.
8. Return the COMPLETE tree and remaining Unprocessed. Never truncate either to fit the output.

1. Give one concise supported answer per Key Question. Combine complementary drafts, retain disagreements and their references. A part's "not addressed" cannot override a supported answer elsewhere. Missing/failed parts are incomplete coverage, not negative evidence.
2.

Use scope/questions and the two lists. Empty lists do not mean automatic yes. Never infer novelty relative to saved knowledge or unseen demonstrations.
