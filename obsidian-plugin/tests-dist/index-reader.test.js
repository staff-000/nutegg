## Task
1. Follow action guide in Egg Instructions
2. Answer each Key Question (if any) directly and concisely based on the content.
3. Extract Knowledge Entries: extract all substantive insights, concepts, frameworks, and findings from the content that fall within this egg's Scope, formatted strictly per the Formatting Rules:
   - Follow the concept \u2192 explanation \u2192 example structure: one top-level bullet "- [tag] **Concept**: short phrases" (without "[tag] " when the egg defines no tags), with the explanation as one indented sub-bullet and concrete examples from the content as further indented sub-bullets ("  - \u{1F3AF} Example: ...") when present. Name each Concept clearly.
   - Structured enumerations / frameworks (numbered lists, step-by-step methods, named frameworks): capture as ONE complete entry preserving EVERY item in order. Never summarize items away, never truncate.
   - Do NOT include author or source \u2014 they are appended automatically.

## Task
1. PRESERVE the existing tree structure as much as possible: do not rename, restructure, or delete existing branches \u2014 the user may have edited them by hand.
2. Deduplicate the entries against EACH OTHER first, comparing their Concepts: entries with the same or equivalent concept are ONE entry, even when the explanations differ \u2014 keep the clearest explanation, fold the others' examples into it, and keep every distinct _author/_source line. A near-duplicate must never appear twice in the merged tree \u2014 dropping redundant rewordings is more valuable than preserving slight wording differences.
3. Structured lists (entries holding a numbered enumeration / framework): entries with the same title are fragments of ONE list \u2014 union their items (drop exact-duplicate items), keep the source's item order. Never truncate a list: every item the source enumerated must survive the merge.
4. Nest each deduplicated entry under the most relevant existing concept as sub-bullets.
5. Only when an entry matches no existing concept, create a new minimal top-level branch for it.
6. Keep each entry's insight, concrete examples, and its _author/_source lines intact when moving it into the tree.
7. If an entry's concept duplicates existing knowledge in the tree, drop it entirely.
8. If an entry cannot be merged meaningfully, leave it in the "unprocessed" output.

Your task is to compare newly extracted candidate knowledge entries from a source against this egg's existing Knowledge tree and Unprocessed entries to identify genuinely NEW insights and decide if the source is worth reading.

## Existing Knowledge in Egg
### Current Knowledge Tree

### Unprocessed Entries (pending merge)
{{unprocessed}}

## Rejection Criteria
{{rejection_criteria}}

## Candidate Knowledge Entries Extracted from Source
**Source Title:** {{title}}
**Source URL:** {{url}}

{{extracted_entries}}

## Task
1. Novel Delta: compare each candidate knowledge entry against the Current Knowledge Tree AND the Unprocessed entries.
   - Compare by CONCEPT: an insight is new only when its core concept is not already covered in the existing knowledge. The same concept with different wording or a different minor example is a DUPLICATE, not new.
   - Classify EVERY candidate entry into either "novelDelta" (genuinely new) or "redundantEntries" (already covered/known in the existing knowledge tree).
   - EXCEPTION \u2014 structured content: when an entry is a well-organized enumeration (a numbered list, a named framework like "Seven Principles of X", a step-by-step process), preserve the COMPLETE list intact in novelDelta unless the entire framework already exists in the tree.
   - For each kept novel entry: determine "parent" \u2014 the EXACT text of the existing bullet or heading in the Current Knowledge tree that best fits as a parent topic to nest under (use "" if no suitable parent exists in the tree).
   - For each redundant entry: determine "existingParent" \u2014 the existing concept or heading it was already covered under.
2. Rejection Criteria:
   - If the content violates the Rejection Criteria or has NO new/novel knowledge for this egg, set "rejected": true and give a one-line "rejectReason".
3. Read Verdict:
   - Decide if the user should spend time reading/watching this source fully ("readVerdict": true/false).
   - If novel, valuable insights were found, set "readVerdict": true with a one-line "readVerdictReason".
   - If redundant, superficial, or noise, set "readVerdict": false with a one-line "readVerdictReason".

## Output Format
Respond in this EXACT JSON format (no markdown, no code fence, just the JSON object):
{
  "novelDelta": [
    {"parent": "exact parent bullet text from knowledge tree or empty string", "kind": "insight", "content": "- formatted entry text\\n  - sub bullets"}
